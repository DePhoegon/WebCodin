Concept on use of JavaScript Arrays for 'database'
Consolidate arrays into one javascript file [ Possible for order ]
use of perhaps 2 or 4 javascripts to keep track of passible directions 
use of a singular array for transfer points on the maps 
--user of another array for warp point 

Use of add/remove images on the sprite later to avoid complications.
Using z-index on class level for all but sprites
use of limted ID on sprites/special objects & z-index as well. 
---------

toy with messing with adding/remove larger divs with a higher z-index for unique things.  [Not sure of it currently.]
